      About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
      In the future I want to work in the field of psychology because I feel as if it is the best way that I can help somebody with their problems. For now, I'm working on trying to get through school with high enough grades to get into a good college. I think to achieve success in what I am working on, it is most of all important to be responsible and strong minded. In the near future, I'm mostly working on becoming better at my hobbies and balancing all the things I do well. In the future, I want to be remembered for what I did for other people.
